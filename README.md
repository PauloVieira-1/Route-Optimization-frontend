# Route Optimization Frontend

A React-based web application for visualizing and interacting with optimized delivery or travel routes.
This project serves as the frontend of the **Route Optimization System**, designed to make logistics and path planning more efficient and user-friendly.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Input multiple locations or stops
* Visualize optimized routes on an interactive map
* Connects to a backend optimization API for real-time results
* Clean and responsive UI built with React

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React** – Frontend framework
* **Typescript / TSX** – Core logic and UI rendering
* **CSS / Bootstrap (if used)** – Styling
* **Backend API** – Consumes route optimization results from the backend service
